### Hello there

You've made it to my GitHub Profile! Take a look around and check out what kinds of stuff I'm working on.

#### What am I working on?

At any given time I've got far too many side projects going on. You can read about my [GitHub Graveyard](https://dev.to/johnbwoodruff/rip-side-projects-2j34) and just know that it's grown since then. ðŸ˜… I am, however, working on a fun new project that I hope to unveil soon! Stay tuned for that.

#### My current employment

I am a Senior Software Engineer at a great company called [GoReact](https://get.goreact.com). There are lots of interesting problems to be solved and I'm loving it. Previously I was a Software Engineer at [Domo](https://domo.com).
